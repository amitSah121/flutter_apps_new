----------------------------------------------

This is how the API computes the bounding box associated with a changeset:

Nodes: Any change to a node, including deletion, adds the node's old and new location to the bbox.
Ways: Any change to a way, including deletion, adds all of the way's nodes to the bbox.
Relations:
adding or removing nodes or ways from a relation causes them to be added to the changeset bounding box.
adding a relation as a member or changing tag values causes all node and way members to be added to the bounding box.
this is similar to how the map call does things and is reasonable on the assumption that adding or removing members doesn't materially change the rest of the relation.
As an optimisation the server will create a buffer slightly larger than the objects to avoid having to update the bounding box too often. Thus a changeset may have a different bounding box than its reversion, and the distance between bounding box and the next node may not be constant for all four directions.
